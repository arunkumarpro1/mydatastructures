Implementation of LinkedList and Stack

**MyLinkedList**
----------------

 Standard Linked List implementation with the following additional methods.

   a.  swap
        receives two index positions as parameters, and swaps the nodes at
        these positions by changing the links, provided both positions are 
        within the current size

   b.  shift
        receives an integer (positive or negative) and shifts the list this
        many positions forward (if positive) or backward (if negative).  
           1,2,3,4    shifted +2    3,4,1,2
           1,2,3,4    shifted -1    4,1,2,3

   c.  erase 
        receives an index position and number of elements as parameters, and
        removes elements beginning at the index position for the number of 
        elements specified, provided the index position is within the size
        and together with the number of elements does not exceed the size

   d.  insertList
        receives another MyLinkedList and an index position as parameters, and 
        copies the list from the passed list into the list at the specified
        position, provided the index position does not exceed the size.

   e.  main
        add code to the main method to demonstrate each of your methods
  
**MyStack**
----------------

Implementation of Stack that uses an ArrayList with additional method to check for balanced symbols.
